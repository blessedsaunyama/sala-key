                    A cryptographic hash function is an algorithm that takes an input (or 'message') of any size and returns a fixed-size string of bytes. This output is called the hash, hash value, digest, or simply message digest.
                  </p>
                   <p>
                    The process is <strong className="text-foreground">deterministic</strong>, meaning the same input will always produce the same output. It's designed to be a <strong className="text-foreground">one-way function</strong>, which means it is computationally infeasible to reverse the process and find the original input from its hash.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Good hash functions are also designed to be <strong className="text-foreground">collision-resistant</strong>. This means it should be extremely difficult to find two different inputs that produce the exact same hash output. Hash functions are fundamental to data integrity verification, password storage, and blockchain technology.

                        Symmetric encryption (also known as secret-key encryption) uses a single, shared key to both encrypt and decrypt data. For two parties to communicate securely, they must both have access to the same secret key. This method is very fast and efficient, making it ideal for encrypting large volumes of data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       The <strong className="text-foreground">Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</strong> is the most widely used symmetric algorithm today. It is a block cipher, meaning it operates on fixed-size blocks of data (128 bits). The key size can be 128, 192, or 256 bits, with longer keys providing stronger encryption. AES is considered highly secure and is trusted by governments and corporations worldwide for protecting sensitive information.

                        The primary challenge with symmetric encryption is <strong className='text-foreground'>key distribution</strong>â€”how to securely share the secret key between the sender and receiver without it being intercepted.
